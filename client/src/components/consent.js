There will be no personally identifiable information collected during this study. The risks involved are no greater than those involved in daily activities.  You will not benefit or be compensated for joining this study. We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB may review study records.
